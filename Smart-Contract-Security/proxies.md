<br>

### Unitialized proxy bug

<br>

* Developers might leave proxies unitialized - this can be a problem when it leads to changes such as granting ownership to the caller
* the owners of the contract can upgrade the implementation contract
* this bug can lead to the self-destruction of the implementation contract (proxy contract is bricked)
