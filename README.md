### tl; dr:


##### üëæ this repository is a catalog from my own (free time / out-of-curiosity) research and development. i open-source it to fight some lousy actors' agenda to conceal the space. there are a lot of just people working on making ensure stays fair. if you are passionate about decentralization and self-sovereignty, don't be intimidated by the toxicity in the space: do your homework and join us (we need you).
