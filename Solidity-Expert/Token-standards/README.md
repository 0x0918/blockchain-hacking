## Token standards

### [ERC20](https://github.com/bt3gl-labs/Blockchain-Hacking-Toolkit/blob/main/Solidity-Expert/Token-standards/erc20.md)

* In the case of ERC20, a transaction sending ether to an address changes the state of an address. A transaction transferring a token to an address only changes the state of the token contract, not the state of the recipient address.
