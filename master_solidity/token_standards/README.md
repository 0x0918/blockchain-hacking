## Token standards

<br>

* ERC stands for Ethereum request for comments. 
* These are technical documents written by Ethereum developers for Ethereum community. 
* Each such document contains a set of rules required to implement tokens for the Ethereum ecosystem.
* You can say ERC is a specific type of EIP.

* In the case of ERC20, a transaction sending ether to an address changes the state of an address. A transaction transferring a token to an address only changes the state of the token contract, not the state of the recipient address.
