## üç± the evm

<br>

### tl;dr

* EVM is a quasi-Turing complete machine (quasi because computation is intrinsically bounded/limited through a parameter: gas) 
* EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts.
* "Ethereum virtual machine code" or "EVM code" are cute lil code are written in a low-level, stack-based bytecode language, each byte represents an operation.
* EVM memory is a simple stack-based architecture with: stack, volatile memory, non-volatile storage (word size of 256-bit) and the fearful Calldata.
