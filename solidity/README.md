* There are at least 2 reasons why you might use inheritance in smart contract developmnet. First, it allows changes in one parent contract to be reflected in child contracts. Second, it allow you to reuse code and reduce overall program length.
* Interfaces cannot define state variables or constructors, functions have to be external, and interfaces cannot themselves inherit from other contracts.
